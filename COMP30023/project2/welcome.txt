		~Welcome to Chang's Mastermind Game Server!~
_______________________________________________________________________________

	INTRO: Chang is trying to break into his friend's computer but
	       it is protected by a code!

               (It is rumoured that this code is unbreakable!)

	       Chang is not patient enough to try all the possibilities.
	       SO! He wants to hire you as his 'codebreaker'!

  HOW TO PLAY: As 'codebreaker' you will have 10 attempts to break the 
	       code before Chang's friend will realise that you're
	       trying to steal his secret files.
	       
	       For each attempt, you must enter a 4 colour code.
	       A colour is one of { A, B, C, D, E, F }.
	       (NOTE: Duplicates are allowed!)

	       If your guess is INVALID, the server will respond 
               with INVALID.

	       If your guess is VALID, the server will respond with
	       SUCCESS if you guessed correctly, otherwise it will return
	       a hint [b:m].

	       b - is the number of correct colours in your code AND
	       also in the correct position.

	       m - is the number of correct colours in your code AND
	       NOT in the correct position.
