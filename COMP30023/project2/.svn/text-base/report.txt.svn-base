Intro:
My game server when sent a SIGINT signal
will log the amount of virtual and physical 
memory used by the server in bytes.

Testing: (VM for virtual memory used and 
PM for Physical memory used. This data is 
from log.txt when the server exits.) 

digitalis:
0 concurrent clients:
VM = 16875520 bytes, PM = 716800 bytes

my virtual machine:
0 concurrent clients:
VM = 15073280 bytes, PM = 720896 bytes
1 concurrent client:
VM = 159870976 bytes, PM = 1130496 bytes

My windows laptop:
0 concurrent clients:
VM = 85524480 bytes
PM = 87818240 bytes

These results suggest that virtual machines
use less physical memory than physical machines.
